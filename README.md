# Understanding IEEE 754 Floating Point Numbers - Practical Exercises

This was an assignment for my Discrete Mathematics in Computer Programming course. The objective was to use a language that supports IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic and perform various calculations within the program showing the IEEE 754 results.
